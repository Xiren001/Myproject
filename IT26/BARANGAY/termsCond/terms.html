                HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT ARISES
                (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND ALL RELATED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL
                OR ON APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER OR NOT LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS INSTITUTED), WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF
                CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
                INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING FROM THIS
                AGREEMENT AND ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS, STATUTES, RULES, OR
                REGULATIONS, EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS
                PROHIBITED BY LAW, IF THERE IS LIABILITY FOUND ON THE PART OF COMPANY, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT
                PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE CONSEQUENTIAL OR
                PUNITIVE DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR
                CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
              <p>16. <b>Termination</b></p>
              <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice or
                liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but
                not limited to a breach of Terms.</p>
              <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.</p>
              <p>All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
                including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
                liability.</p>
              <p>17. <b>Governing Law</b></p>
              <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Philippines, which governing
                law applies to agreement without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
              <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
                rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining
                provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us
                regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us
                regarding Service.</p>
              <p>18. <b>Changes To Service</b></p>
              <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide via
                Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part
                of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to
                some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.</p>
              <p>19. <b>Amendments To Terms</b></p>
              <p>We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility to
                review these Terms periodically.</p>
              <p>Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and
                agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as
                they are binding on you.</p>
              <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound
                by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.
              </p>
              <p>20. <b>Waiver And Severability</b></p>
              <p>No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or
                continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure
                of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision.</p>
              <p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
                illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
                extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
